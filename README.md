Hello every one, after the success of my precedent project : 


**[Xcloud Beta for Shield TV](https://github.com/mistertest/xcloud-shield)**

I'm proud to give the best optimized and integrated Xcloud experience in Android TV for the Shield TV as this day (Xbox Official have not a android TV solution).

So, I decided to continue my adventure about cloud Gaming and Android technology with an exclusive : 

**The Luna App for the shield tv**.





**Context**

Originally **Luna** is **accessible** by a "**Progressive Web App**" (PWA) on Smart-phone and Tablets with specifics models Android and Apple only. 

**Amazon Luna** can be used officially on certain Box TV from Amazon : All models of "**Fire Stick**" and "**Fire Cubes**". 
Their devices are very closed and restricted, and they have the "Fire Os " an android tv modified and closed from Amazon.

So, there is not a Android tv version for other box android TV and the queen of them : **The Nvidia Shield TV**

I'm glad to share with you this **World Premiere Unofficial**.





**Version info**

This first **pre-release** version of the **Luna** is here for testing and feedback reviews

**Known issues**

- The major issue is the margin on left/right and bottom around the stream. 

I'm working about this issue, but games are playable with no issues in the shield TV.
***Resolved***




**Mapping Select/Back Button**

Like with the Xcloud beta App, the mapping of the select/back button on the shield TV is an issue and can be resolved with the **EKH** (External Keyboard Helper). It's basically a key button mapper for controllers and keyboard. So you'll have to do the same than the xcloud app and refer at the wiki page here :
