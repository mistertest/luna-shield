### Context

Originally **Luna** is **accessible** by a "**Progressive Web App**" (PWA) on Smart-phone and Tablets with specifics models Android and Apple only. 

**Amazon Luna** can be used officially on certain Box TV from Amazon : All models of "**Fire Stick**" and "**Fire Cubes**". 
Their devices are very closed and restricted, and they have the "Fire Os " an android tv modified and closed from Amazon.

So, there is not a Android tv version for other box android TV and the queen of them : **The Nvidia Shield TV**

I'm glad to share with you this **World Premiere Unofficial**.





### Version info

 **Release Stable V1**

### Known issues


**Mapping Select/Back Button**

Like with the Xcloud beta App, the mapping of the select/back button on the shield TV is an issue and can be resolved with the **EKH** (External Keyboard Helper). It's basically a key button mapper for controllers and keyboard. So you'll have to do the same than the xcloud app and refer at the wiki page here :
